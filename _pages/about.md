## How it started
Mystery Bots Studios started as an idea of a place I could group all the Discord bots that I created over the years under one singular name and organization. Since the creation of [Among Us Bot](https://aub.mysterybots.com) I decided that I should grow this into an actual Studio based around creating Discord bots.

## Why the name 
The name Mystery Bots Studios came from obviously my username online(TheMystery) and also my love for creating Discord bots.

## Future plans
The future plans for Mystery Bots Studios is to continue to develop bots that people can appreciate and create enjoyable experiences with. With this we also want to allow users to continue to trust us with the bots we create and feel that what we will fulfill this promise.
